1.What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?
--> A .gitignore file is a hidden file that contains patterns of the files that are not needed to be added by the user on to their git hub repository. Such files include autogenerated files by the system for example. For a java project the .git ignore file should include all .class files created, all .log files created by the system. .project files (if you are using eclipse), the jvm crash logs, packaging files (tar, jar, raw, etc), BlueJ files (.ctxt) & mobile tools for Java files.

2. What does fast-forward in Git mean?
-->A method used by git during merging where git moves the pointer forward in cases where there is no divergent work to merge.

3. Why should you have different branches?
--> There are many reasons to have different branches, one is to allow collaborative work to go more smoothly as teammates do not have to worry about each other's work interfering in their tasks (in cases of unrelated tasks) while coding. Another example could be for testing code without risking the over base code. Individual branches also allow for easier back traces to working versions.
4. In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
--> One.
